//Week 1 - Project 1

// Log all answers to the console and write them to document
// =======================================================

//1. Log your name to the console (as a string).

console.log("Tommy")

//2. Declare a variable called name, log it to the console.

var name = "Tommy"

console.log(name)

//3. Declare two variables with number values. Add, subtract, multiply and divide them.

var number1 = 5

var number2 = 10

number1 + number2
15
number2 - number1
5
number1 * number2
50
number2 / number1
2

//4. Declare two variables with string values. Create a third variable that concatenates them.

var greeting = "Hello"

var to = " Jenny"

var concatenate = greet

var concatenate = greeting + to

console.log(concatenate)

Hello Jenny

//5. Add, subract, multiply and divide the strings '5' and '3'. Observe and explain the results.

"5" + "3"
"53"

//Adding the strings 5 and 3 concatenates them. Using the opperator + on strings concatantes them, any other opperator does the math.

"5" - "3"
2
"5" * "3"
15
"5" / "3"
1.6666666666666667

//6. Create a prompt that asks a user to pick a number. Double the answer.

var number = prompt("Pick a number!")

console.log(number * 2)

//7. Create a custom alert.

alert("Custom Alert")

//8. Declare three variables called length, width and height. Calculate area and volume.

var length = 5

var width = 2

var height = 10

console.log(height * width * length)
100

//9. Ask for a user's name, age and city. In a single command display/log the sentence:
// "My name is...I'm....years old, and I live in....."

var name = prompt("What is your name?")

var age = prompt("What is your age?")

var city = prompt("What city do you live in?")

confirm("My name is " + name + ", I'm " + age + " years old, and I live in " + city + "!")

//10. Create an alert that uses the response from a prompt.

var response = prompt("What is your favorite color?")

alert(response)
